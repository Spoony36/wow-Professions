N Extracting Oil|N| You can extract Aromatic Fish Oil from any Battle for Azeroth fish\nYou have to right-click the fish you caught, and it will convert the fish into oil.
N Fish|N| Fishes no longer come from one specific zone\nInstead, you can find 3 types of fish in the Kul Tiras zones\n3 in the Zandalar zones, 2 in Nazjatar, 1 in Mechagon and you can fish 2 in all zones.
N Fish|N|Mechagon:Ionized Minnow\nNazjatar:Viper Fish,Mauve Stinger\nKul Tiras:Frenzied Fangtooth and Lane Snapper - Fished from seas/oceans\nTiragarde Perch - Fished from rivers/lakes\nZandalar:Slimy Mackerel and Sand Shifter - Fished from seas/oceans & Redtail Loach - Fished from rivers/lakes\nAll zones:Great Sea Catfish - Rivers and lakes(except Nazjatar), Midnight Salmon - Everywhere(rare fish, around 3% catch rate)
L Levelling from 1 - 35|N| Cook 34 x Mon'Dazi
N Action|N|Learn the Rank 2 recipes from your trainer
N Note|N|You don't have to make Kul Tiramisu, you can make any other dessert recipe\nCook 15 x Rank 2 - Kul Tiramisu
L Levelling from 50 - 75|N| Make 25 from one of the these three\n25 x Seasoned Loins\n25 x Honey-Glazed Haunches\n25 x Sailor's Pie\nIf you make Seasoned Loins, don't vendor them! Sometimes you can use them for Warfront Contributions quests when the Warfronts are up.
N Note|N| These meats are usually really cheap\nI recommend to switch to these dishes at 50, but if they are expensive on your realm, then it's better to make more Rank 2 - Kul Tiramisu up to around 75\nAs a general rule, if 1 Aromatic Fish Oil cost around the same as these meats, then you should make Kul Tiramisu because even if you have to craft 2-3 for a skill point, you would still only need 4-6 Fish Oil, instead of the 10 meats.
N Learn the Rank 2 recipes from your trainer
N Action|N|Make around 120 from one of these three\nRank 2 - Seasoned Loins\nRank 2 - Honey-Glazed Haunches\nRank 2 - Sailor's Pie\nThese will be green for the last 10 points, so you might have to make more.
