But only buy it if you have more than 18 Mark of Honor. You should save 12 Mark of Honor for the last two recipe.|FACTION|Horde|
N If you have a lot of Mark of Honor, buy the rank 2 and rank 3 from these NPCs|N|Sold by Leedan Gustaf in Boralus.You will only need 200 Storm Silver Ore if you buy the rank 3 recipes.

N Learn Rank 2 - Monel-Hardened Hoofplates from your trainer. Then go somewhere in Zandalar or Kul Tiras where you can find a lot of HUMANOID mobs, then kill those mobs until you get the Rank 3 - Recipe: Monel-Hardened Hoofplates. The drop rate is high. You should get this recipe after 10-20 kills. (drops only from Humanoid mobs). Note: Make sure you don't already have the recipe in your bags/bank, because it won't drop twice.

N 95 - 115|N| Craft 20 x Rank 3 - Monel-Hardened Hoofplates - 300 x Monelite Ore

N 115 - 145|N| The materials required for this part will depend on if you have any Mark of Honor or if you are willing to do PvP to get some. If you don't have any Mark of Honor, but you want to reach 145, your best option is to wait until you get to revered with The Honorbound then you can buy the rank 3 Stormsteel recipes..  I understand that a lot of players hate PvP, but I highly recommend to farm the 6 Mark of Honor. It's a lot cheaper to level Blacksmithing with Sinister/Notorious Combatant Combatant weapons and armors.. How to get Mark of Honor?. You can get Mark of Honor from doing Battlegrounds and Arenas. The most reliable way is to just do some Battlegrounds since you get Mark of Honor most of the time. You will get 2 for a win, and 1 for a loss but only if you don't lose with very low score (like 100-200 score, or 0 flags). If you want to farm it in arena, then you have to pray to the RNG gods, because the box which contains Mark of Honor is rewarded randomly after winning.. How to get Expulsom?. You need a lot of Expulsom to reach 175, so check out my guide on How to get Expulsom, if you don't know how to get this crafting item.Leveling with Mark of Honor. Buy the rank 2 and rank 3 Recipe: Sinister Combatant's Plate Armguards recipe for 6 Mark of Honor from Ozgrom Ragefang in Zuldazar.|FACTION|Horde|
