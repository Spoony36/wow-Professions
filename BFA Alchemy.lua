N Disclaimer|N|We are not saying you have to follow this guide, we have provided it as a base guideline only so any errors/suggestions please post in the discord group as normal.\n You may have a better way of levelling your profession, if so we welcome suggestions on edits that can be made.
N BFA Alchemy Trainer Location |N| You can find Clever Kumali in Dazar'alor at the Terrace of Crafters.\n You can walk up to a guard in Dazar'alor then ask where the Alchemy trainer is located. \n This will place a red marker on your map at the trainer's location|FACTION|Horde|
N BFA Alchemy Trainer Location |N| Elric Whalgrene is located in Boralus at the Tradewinds Market.\n You can walk up to a guard in Boralus then ask where the Alchemy trainer is located. \n This will place a red marker on your map at the trainer's location|FACTION|Alliance|
N Recipe ranks...|N|Most BfA Alchemy recipes have 3 ranks\n Rank 2 reduces the materials required to create a recipe\n Rank 3 have a chance to create multiple potions/flask etc\nHigher rank recipes also give skill points much longer,so it will be a lot cheaper to level Alchemy if you first get Revered with the new BfA factions because you can use cheaper recipes for longer.
N Approximate Materials Required|N|At most steps, there are multiple potions that you can craft to level Alchemy, therefore I can't list the exact number of herbs needed to reach 175.\n Also keep in mind that if you are Revered with most factions, then you will need fewer herbs because you can level with rank 3 recipes.
N Note|N|Below you will find a list that is usually the cheapest way to level but the price of herbs varies from realm to realm\n 70 x Siren's Pollen.\n 70 x Riverbud.\n 580 x Sea Stalk.\n 140 x Anchor Weed.\n 280 x Winter's Kiss\n 820 x Star Moss\n 110 x Zin'anthid
N Levelling from 1 to 37|N|Make the following\n 20 x Coastal Healing Potion\n 20 x Coastal Mana Potion\n Save these, you will use them later\n
N Levelling from 37  to 40|N|Make 3 from any of these\n 3 x Demitri's Draught of Deception\n 3 x Lightfoot Potion\n 3 x Potion of Concealment\n 3 x Sea Mist Potion\n You might have to make more than 3 if you were unlucky with the skill gains(or fewer if you were lucky)\n
